This login system was built as one of my first projects using PHP.
The database wont work as I've redacted my login details for phpmyadmin.
The code has been tested and is working fine.
I would like to update this at some point so the errors when registering redirect the user back to the register page 
and display the errors there, rather than having the errors on a seperate page and having to go back to edit the registration form.
